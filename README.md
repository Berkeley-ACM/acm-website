# Website for Berkeley's Branch of the Association for Computed Machinery


### Read before modifying:
- if you are unfamiliar with the site organization/how your changes will affect functionality, **please PR instead of committing directly :)**
- the site was prototyped and made through [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io/), which quickly creates responsive webpages using Bootstrap.
    - it is recommended that you use this software to open the `ACM.bsdesign` file and edit the site from there. Then, the source code could be exported with the correct directory configuratoins.
    - Bootstrap Studio is free for students that hold the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack?sort=popularity&tag=Design)
- modifying the site directly without using Bootstrap Studio will not modify the `.bsdesign` file, and should another developer update the site through Bootstrap Studio, your changes may be overridden.
